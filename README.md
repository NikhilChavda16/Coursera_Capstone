# Coursera_Capstone
## Introduction/Business Problem:
Using the collisions data provided by Coursera for the final capstone course, I wanted to look into the severity of car accidents that are due to bad weather conditions. How many car accidents are caused due to bad weather conditions? This data will bring awareness to people to drive extra cautiously during bad weather!

## Data 
Using the data provided by Coursera on Collisions, I will investigate the connection between severity of car accidents and weather conditions. This data provides collisions from 2004 to the present in Seattle.
